## Project description
This is a simple pictures viewer with interface similar to native Photos app.

From a strict user point of view, a camera roll is a vertical list displaying a list of pictures. Nothing more üòÅ. 

From an engineering standpoint, it‚Äôs a scrolling container that should display images as efficiently as possible, using techniques like multi-threading, caching, etc.

It uses https://randomuser.me/ API as a backend for pictures.

## Architecture and key technologies

1. **Module architecture** with separate UI and BL targets
  ```
  Please look at Project.swift file for projects's and targets' settings
  Project structure:
  
                +-------------+
                |             |
                |     App     | Contains CameraRoll App target and CameraRoll unit-test target
                |             |
         +------+-------------+-------+
         |         depends on         |
         |                            |
 +----v-----+                   +-----v-----+
 |          |                   |           |
 |   Kit    |                   |     UI    |
 |          |                   |           |
 +----------+                   +-----------+
```


2. **MVVM + Coordinators** for presentation layer
4. **Swift UI and Combine** for fun and reactive development
