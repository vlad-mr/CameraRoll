## Build steps:
1. Download project
2. Open folder in **Terminal**
3. Run `tuist generate --open`
4. Select your **dev team (for all targets)** before building for Device, no additional work for Simulator
5. Build with **Xcode** or `tuist build` and have fun
6. <sub>If you see issue with file permisions run `chmod +x swiftlint.sh`</sub>

## Dependencies:
1. **Tuist** for project generation
2. **SPM** for obvious things
3. **Moya** for network communication
4. **Localize_Swift, PartialSheet and SwiftDate** just in case


## Project description
This is a simple pictures viewer with interface similar to native Photos app.

From a strict user point of view, a camera roll is a vertical list displaying a list of pictures. Nothing more üòÅ. 

From an engineering standpoint, it‚Äôs a scrolling container that should display images as efficiently as possible, using techniques like multi-threading, caching, etc.

It uses https://randomuser.me/ API as a backend for pictures.

## Architecture and key technologies

1. **Modular architecture** with separate UI and BL targets

  Please look at [Project.swift](https://github.com/vlad-mr/CameraRoll/blob/dev/Project.swift) file for project's and targets' settings.
  
  Or run `tuist graph` to see project graph.
